# Compact Direct Percolation (CDP) Critical Exponents
Python implementation for simulate a discrete Random Walk with two absorbing barriers. This is related to the beta prime critical exponent of the CDP universality class. _simulation_ contains this implementation.
_notes_ contains a `.tex` file and the compiled `pdf` describing the random walk theory used to compute CDP critical exponents, included the simulated process.
`presentation.pdf` described briefly the argument and the results obtained from the simulation.

This is part of the final project of the Complex Systems course held at the University of Padua during the academic year 2019/2020.
